# spring-boot-application
In this project, I have implemented a RESTFul web service in Spring Boot Application. I have used Spring CRUD Repository to persist Course and Topic Information, by leveraging MySql as a database.

Steps to deploy the application.
1. Import the maven project in your favorite IDE. I prefer to use Eclipse
2. Open pom.xml file, right click on it and choose run->maven install
3. Open SpringCourseApiDataApplication.java and run this file as a Java program.
